**dyce: the DYe Chess Engine**

This project is still in its infancy...currently, this GitHub repository exists so that I can easily work on the
project from both my desktop and laptop. Feel free to browse the code, but don't expect to find a working chess
engine just yet.

If you're interested in contributing to this project, or if you have any questions about it, feel free to contact me,
